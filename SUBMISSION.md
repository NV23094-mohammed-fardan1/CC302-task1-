---

**A. Branch list output**

Run: `git fetch --all && git branch -a`

```
* main
  remotes/origin/Features/Backend
  remotes/origin/Features/Docker
  remotes/origin/Features/Frontend
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/main
```

(Attach a screenshot of this output in your submission if required.)

---

**B. Feature PR links (feature → dev)**

The feature PRs were created and merged into `dev`:

- Feature 1 (task descriptions → dev): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/pull/1
- Feature 2 (search → dev): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/pull/2
- Feature 3 (filters & sorting → dev): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/pull/3

---

**C. Release PR (dev → main)**

- Release PR (dev → main): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/pull/4

**D. DockerHub tags screenshot**

I have attached or referenced your DockerHub screenshot showing tags (e.g., `latest`, `2.0.2`, `v1.2.0`, `v1.1.2`). Replace/attach the image file `dockerhub-tags.png` next to this Markdown when producing the final PDF.

DockerHub repo URL (from your screenshot): https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app/general

If you prefer a tags-only view use: https://hub.docker.com/r/nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app/tags

Suggested Docker commands used:

```bash
# Build locally
docker build -t nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:2.0.2 .

# Push (after docker login)
docker push nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:2.0.2

docker tag nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:2.0.2 nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:latest

docker push nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:latest
```

Note: I retagged a local image to `2.0.2` here, but pushing from this environment failed due to Docker Hub authentication scopes. Please run the push commands locally after `docker login`, or provide credentials if you want me to push from this environment.

---

**E. GitHub Release link**

- Release: https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/releases/tag/v2.0.2 (tag `v2.0.2`)

---

**F. Short reflection (what I learned about branching + merging)**

I used a branching workflow with a stable `main`, an integration `dev`, and feature branches created from `dev`. This structure kept work isolated: each feature branch contained only the commits relevant to its feature, which made Pull Requests concise and easier to review. Merging via PRs into `dev` allowed integration testing before releasing; then merging `dev` into `main` created a clear release point for containerization and tagging. Resolving conflicts on feature branches before merging helped keep `dev` history clean. Overall, this workflow improved parallel development safety, made code review straightforward, and produced reliable, versioned releases.

---

**Notes & next steps**

- Docker push: run `docker login` locally and push the `2.0.2` image if not already present on Docker Hub.
- If you want I can produce `submission.pdf` including the DockerHub screenshot — upload the image file and I will generate the PDF.
