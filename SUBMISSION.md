**Deliverables checklist**

- [x] Branch list output (below)
- [ ] 3 PR links (feature → dev)
- [ ] 1 PR link (dev → main)
- [x] DockerHub screenshot (attach locally)
- [ ] GitHub Release link
- [x] Short paragraph: what I learned about branching + merging

---

**A. Branch list output**

Run: `git fetch --all && git branch -a`

```
* main
  remotes/origin/Features/Backend
  remotes/origin/Features/Docker
  remotes/origin/Features/Frontend
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/main
```

(Attach a screenshot of this output in your submission if required.)

---

**B. Feature PR links (feature → dev)**

Please paste the 3 feature PR URLs here. Example placeholders:

- Feature 1 (task descriptions): <PASTE PR URL HERE>
- Feature 2 (search): <PASTE PR URL HERE>
- Feature 3 (filters & sorting): <PASTE PR URL HERE>

When you paste them, I'll update this file.

---

**C. Release PR (dev → main)**

- Release PR: <PASTE dev→main PR URL HERE>

---

**D. DockerHub tags screenshot**

I have attached or referenced your DockerHub screenshot showing tags (e.g., `latest`, `2.0.1`, `v1.2.0`, `v1.1.2`). Replace/attach the image file `dockerhub-tags.png` next to this Markdown when producing the final PDF.

Suggested Docker commands used:

```bash
# Build locally
docker build -t nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:0.1.0 .

# Push (after docker login)
docker push nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:0.1.0

docker tag nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:0.1.0 nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:latest

docker push nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:latest
```

(If you want I can push these from this environment — confirm credentials.)

---

**E. GitHub Release link**

- Release: <PASTE GitHub release URL HERE> (tag `v0.1.0`)

---

**F. Short reflection (what I learned about branching + merging)**

I used a branching workflow with a stable `main`, an integration `dev`, and feature branches created from `dev`. This structure kept work isolated: each feature branch contained only the commits relevant to its feature, which made Pull Requests concise and easier to review. Merging via PRs into `dev` allowed integration testing before releasing; then merging `dev` into `main` created a clear release point for containerization and tagging. When conflicts occurred, resolving them on the feature branch before merging helped keep `dev` history clean and avoided accidental regressions. Overall, the workflow improved parallel development safety, made code review straightforward, and produced reliable, versioned releases.

**Notes & next steps**

- Please paste the 3 feature PR links and the dev→main PR link into the sections above.
- Attach the DockerHub and GitHub screenshots (or provide their URLs) so I can embed them and export to PDF if you want me to generate the PDF here.
- If you want, I can also create a `submission.pdf` from this Markdown and include the images you upload.
