**A. Branch list output**

Run: `git fetch --all && git branch -a`

```
* main
  remotes/origin/Features/Backend
  remotes/origin/Features/Docker
  remotes/origin/Features/Frontend
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/main
```

(Attach a screenshot of this output in your submission if required.)

---

**B. Feature PR links (feature → dev)**

Please paste the 3 feature PR URLs here. Example placeholders:

- Feature 1 (task descriptions): <PASTE PR URL HERE>
- Feature 2 (search): <PASTE PR URL HERE>
- Feature 3 (filters & sorting): <PASTE PR URL HERE>
 - Feature 1 (task descriptions): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/compare/dev...Features/Backend?expand=1
 - Feature 2 (search): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/compare/dev...Features/Frontend?expand=1
 - Feature 3 (filters & sorting): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/compare/dev...Features/Docker?expand=1

When you paste them, I'll update this file.

---

**C. Release PR (dev → main)**

- Release PR: <PASTE dev→main PR URL HERE>
 - Release PR (create PR to merge `dev` into `main`): https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/compare/main...dev?expand=1

---

**D. DockerHub tags screenshot**

I have attached or referenced your DockerHub screenshot showing tags (e.g., `latest`, `2.0.1`, `v1.2.0`, `v1.1.2`). Replace/attach the image file `dockerhub-tags.png` next to this Markdown when producing the final PDF.

DockerHub repo URL (from your screenshot): https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app/general

If you prefer a tags-only view use: https://hub.docker.com/r/nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app/tags

Suggested Docker commands used:

```bash
# Build locally
docker build -t nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:2.0.1 .

# Push (after docker login)
docker push nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:2.0.1

docker tag nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:2.0.1 nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:latest

docker push nv23094mohammedfardan/todo-app:latest
```

(If you want I can push these from this environment — confirm credentials.)

---

**E. GitHub Release link**

- Release: <PASTE GitHub release URL HERE> (tag `v0.1.0`)

If you create the release with tag `v0.1.0`, the release URL will be:

https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/releases/tag/v0.1.0

If you haven't created the release yet, you can create it at:

https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/releases/new

After creating it paste the release URL here.

---

**F. Short reflection (what I learned about branching + merging)**

I used a branching workflow with a stable `main`, an integration `dev`, and feature branches created from `dev`. This structure kept work isolated: each feature branch contained only the commits relevant to its feature, which made Pull Requests concise and easier to review. Merging via PRs into `dev` allowed integration testing before releasing; then merging `dev` into `main` created a clear release point for containerization and tagging. When conflicts occurred, resolving them on the feature branch before merging helped keep `dev` history clean and avoided accidental regressions. Overall, the workflow improved parallel development safety, made code review straightforward, and produced reliable, versioned releases.

**Notes & next steps**

- Please paste the 3 feature PR links and the dev→main PR link into the sections above.
- Attach the DockerHub and GitHub screenshots (or provide their URLs) so I can embed them and export to PDF if you want me to generate the PDF here.
- If you want, I can also create a `submission.pdf` from this Markdown and include the images you upload.

Helpful URL patterns and where to find things on GitHub/DockerHub

- Feature PRs (example pattern):
  https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/pull/<PR_NUMBER>
- Dev→Main release PR: https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/pull/<PR_NUMBER>
- Git tags page: https://github.com/NV23094-mohammed-fardan1/CC302-task1-/releases

Paste the actual links above and I'll update this file and produce a PDF if you want.
